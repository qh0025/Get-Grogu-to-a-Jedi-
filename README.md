# Get-Grogu-to-a-Jedi-
Quintilian Huynh

Text-based Survival Game on Mandalorian inspired by Oregon Trails (1971)

The goal of the game is to survive twenty weeks maintaining currency, resources, and health all while trying to stay under the radar of not getting caught or failing ill.  Every action has benefits and consequences on the status of the player and what they need to maintain in order to not game over.  By allowing user input as well as random number generator, anything can happen in a game with multiple endings.

Main Rules:

- You can continue earning money if your ship (Razorcrest) is up and running. No ship no money.
- It is game over if your Endurance, Grogu's health, or if your credits reaches 0 so be mindful of all.
- It is also game over if your notoriety level reaches 100% and Moff Gideon finds your location.


There is also a secret/cheat code route to finish the game quickly.
